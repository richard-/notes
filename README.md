notes
=====

A Symfony project.

It allows users to register/login and post private notes.

Users must be logged in to view their notes.


The user management is done by using fosUserBundle.

The database is sqlite.

Most of my code files are in:

Controller: src/AppBundle/Controller/DefaultController.php

Views: app/Resources/views

Models: src/AppBundle/Entity

Forms: src/AppBundle/Form
